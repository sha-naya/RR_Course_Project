# Project for Reproducible Research Course
Reproducible Research course final project (Coursera; Johns Hopkins University)

This analysis uses NOAA Storm Database to show which severe weather events have had the most social 
health and economic impacts on the US population. The data used ranged from 1950 to 2011. The 
findings indicate that when it comes to population health, that is combined cases of injuries 
and fatalities caused, tornadoes are the most harmful. In terms of economic consequences, a metric 
combining crop damage with property damage in USD, floods are the most harmful.

For more detailed information please refer to the .pdf file which includes the full write up of the
results. 

Note: the storm data used in this project does NOT belong to me and was used strictly in educational
purposes.
Note 2: this project is an early representation of my skillset and no longer fully captures my
experience and qualities.
